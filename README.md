This [notebook](https://github.com/margaretmz/met-museum-data-analysis/blob/master/Met_Art_Data_Analysis.ipynb) contains data analysis of the artists and artworks of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 

## Project motivation
As Iâ€™m interested in using AI for art, analyzing the artist and artwork metadata of the Metropolitan Museum of Art helps me choose datasets for computer vision tasks.
